## Enforcing Custom Rules & Patterns

### Core Customization Methods

GitHub Copilot code review can be customized at multiple organizational levels to enforce your team's specific standards:

#### 1. Repository-Level Instructions

Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repository to define project-specific standards.[^1]

**What to include:**
- Coding standards and conventions
- Naming conventions and formatting rules
- Tools and frameworks used in the project
- Best practices specific to your codebase
- Specific review criteria (e.g., "Check for security vulnerabilities in authentication code")

**Example structure:**
```markdown
# Project Coding Standards

## Error Handling
- All API endpoints must implement try-catch blocks
- Use custom error classes for domain-specific errors

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Use camelCase for method names and variables

## Security
- Never commit credentials or API keys
- All user input must be validated and sanitized
```

#### 2. Path-Scoped Instructions (New Feature - Sept 2025)

Use `*.instructions.md` files with an `applyTo` section to target specific directories or file patterns.[^2] This allows different rules for different parts of your codebase.

**Example:** Frontend-specific rules for React components:
- Create `frontend.instructions.md` with targeted rules
- Apply to specific paths like `/src/components/*.tsx`

#### 3. Organization-Level Instructions

Set organization-wide standards that automatically apply across all repositories.[^3] These are now automatically included when generating PR review feedback.

**Priority hierarchy:** Personal > Repository > Organization (all are combined and provided to Copilot)

#### 4. VS Code Settings Configuration

For local development reviews, configure custom instructions in VS Code settings:[^4]

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.enabled": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions": [
    {"file": ".vscode/rules/coding-guidelines.md"},
    {"file": ".vscode/rules/testing-standards.md"},
    {"file": ".vscode/rules/security-patterns.md"}
  ]
}
```

## Latest Features (October 2025)

### Breaking Changes & Updates

**IMPORTANT DEPRECATION:** The standalone "coding guidelines" feature (previously in private preview for Copilot Enterprise) was **completely deprecated on September 3, 2025**. All customization specifications should now be added to `copilot-instructions.md` or `*.instructions.md` files.[^5]

[^5]: [Upcoming deprecations and changes to Copilot code review](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-18-upcoming-deprecations-and-changes-to-copilot-code-review/)

### New Capabilities (October 28, 2025)

The most recent update introduces several powerful features:[^3]

#### Agentic Tool Calling & Full Context Awareness
Copilot code review now "uses agentic tool calling to actively gather full project context, including code, directory structure, and references." This enables it to understand how changes fit within the broader project architecture, not just reviewing code in isolation.

#### Integration with Deterministic Security Tools
CCR now "blends LLM detections and tool calling with deterministic tools like ESLint and CodeQL," delivering "high-signal, consistent findings for security and quality." This combines AI flexibility with rule-based precision.

#### Automated Fix Implementation
Developers can mention `@copilot` in pull requests, and CCR will automatically apply suggested fixes in a stacked PR, reducing "manual cleanup and fewer review cycles."

#### Customizable Review Standards
Teams can define review priorities through `copilot-instructions.md` files, "shaping what CCR prioritizes (e.g., test coverage, performance, or readability)."

#### Multi-Editor Support
CCR is available across VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Xcode, and github.com, ensuring consistent feedback wherever you work.

**Availability:** Tool calling and deterministic detections are in public preview, enabled by default for Copilot Pro and Pro Plus users. Business and Enterprise users can opt in via code review policies.

## Configuration Methods

### Automatic Code Review Setup

You can configure automatic Copilot code reviews using repository rulesets:[^6]

1. Navigate to repository settings
2. Select "Automatically request Copilot code review" in repository rules
3. Optional settings:
   - Review new pushes automatically
   - Review draft pull requests

This is now available as a **standalone repository rule**, allowing adoption of automatic reviews without adding merge gating policies.

## Best Practices

### Workflow Recommendations

#### 1. Pre-PR Quality Checks
"Request code reviews from Copilot before marking pull requests ready."[^7] Copilot can catch overlooked issues and suggest improvements before human reviewers see the code.

[^7]: [How to use GitHub Copilot to level up your code reviews and pull requests](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-use-github-copilot-to-level-up-your-code-reviews-and-pull-requests/)

#### 2. Use Targeted Prompts
Rather than generic "review this code" requests, use specific prompts:
- "Does this follow our error handling patterns?"
- "Are there any security vulnerabilities in this authentication flow?"
- "Does this code follow Go best practices?"[^7]

Click the Copilot icon next to specific files or sections to request targeted improvements rather than manually writing refactored code.

#### 3. Leverage Copilot for Context Understanding
When reviewing unfamiliar code sections, "ask Copilot for explanations to gain proper context before providing feedback."[^7]

#### 4. Streamline PR Documentation
Copilot excels at formatting data into markdown tables, transforming spreadsheets into "GitHub flavored markdown tables" ready for pull request descriptions.[^7] Use it to generate initial PR summaries to provide "a starting point" that's "less daunting."

#### 5. Conversational Review Approach
"Treat Copilot as a coworker: start 'Voice Chat' mode and engage in a conversation just as you would with a teammate."[^4]

### Writing Effective Custom Instructions

Based on practical implementation experience:[^8]

#### Keep Instructions Focused
Real-world testing shows approximately **70% adherence** to defined rules. Too many rules can "degrade the overall quality of generated code."

#### Use Positive Directives
Instructions work better as positive directives rather than prohibitions:
- ✅ **Good:** "Use dependency injection for service classes"
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Don't use static singletons"

#### Structure by Category
Organize rules into focused documents:[^8]
```
.vscode/rules/
├── coding-guidelines.md      # General principles
├── coding-style.md           # Language-specific conventions
├── testing-standards.md      # Test patterns (xUnit, Jest, etc.)
├── security-patterns.md      # Security requirements
└── commit-messages.md        # VCS conventions
```

#### Keep Instructions Short and Self-Contained
"The instructions you add to the file should be short, self-contained statements that add context or relevant information."[^1]

[^8]: [Enforcing .NET Coding Guidelines with GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions](https://nikiforovall.blog/productivity/2025/03/08/github-copilot-instructions-for-dotnet.html)

### Advanced: Custom Prompt Files

Create custom `.prompt.md` files to replicate pull request review functionality while staying in your IDE:[^4]

**Structure:**
- **Description section:** Define the review's purpose and scope
- **Constraints section:** Specify git commands, formatting rules, and priority indicators

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Generate diff for review
git diff --no-prefix --unified=100000 $(git merge-base main --fork-point)...head
```

Use the diff output as input to Copilot for structured feedback with:
- Priority levels (🔥 Critical to 🟢 Low)
- Type indicators (🔧 Changes, ❓ Questions, ♻️ Refactoring)
- Actionable suggestions with code examples

---

## Gotchas & Limitations

### 1. Rule Adherence is Not 100%

Real-world testing shows **approximately 70% adherence** to custom rules.[^8] Copilot should complement, not replace, human code review.

**Mitigation:**
- Use Copilot for first-pass reviews
- Always have human reviewers as final gatekeepers
- Provide feedback when Copilot misses rules to improve over time

### 2. Excessive Rules Degrade Quality

"Excessive rules can 'degrade the overall quality of generated code.'"[^8] There's a balance between providing guidance and overwhelming the system.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on your most critical 10-15 rules
- Prioritize security and architectural patterns over style preferences
- Test rule effectiveness and refine based on results

### 3. Pattern Replication from Public Repos

"Copilot had recreated patterns from public repositories that were inappropriate for their regulatory environment."[^9] This is particularly concerning for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government).

**Mitigation:**
- Clearly specify regulatory requirements in custom instructions
- Use path-scoped instructions for sensitive code areas
- Implement mandatory human review for compliance-critical code

[^9]: [AI Agent Code Generation Risks: Securing GitHub Copilot X in 2025's Dev Environments](https://markaicode.com/ai-agent-code-securing-github-copilot-x-2025/)

### 4. Large Repository Considerations

For large repositories with multiple contributors, the documentation cautions against "instructions requesting external resource references or specific response styles, as these 'may cause problems' with consistency and effectiveness."[^1]

**Mitigation:**
- Keep instructions self-contained
- Focus on architectural patterns over external references
- Use path-scoped instructions to manage complexity

### 5. Context Window Limitations (Being Addressed)

Historically, Copilot reviews were limited by context window size. The October 2025 update addresses this with agentic tool calling,[^3] but it's still in public preview.

**Current state:** "CCR now uses agentic tool calling to actively gather full project context, including code, directory structure, and references."

### 6. Requires Ongoing Refinement

"Copilot requires ongoing code review and feedback."[^8] Custom instructions aren't "set it and forget it" — they need iteration based on what works.

**Best practice:**
- Review Copilot's suggestions regularly
- Update instructions based on what it misses
- Gather team feedback on instruction effectiveness

---

## Practical Implementation Examples

### Example 1: .NET Codebase with xUnit

From the real-world implementation by Oleksii Nikiforov:[^8]

**Configuration structure:**
```
.vscode/rules/
├── csharp/
│   ├── coding-guidelines.md     # "Write clear, self-documenting code"
│   ├── coding-style.md          # C# conventions
│   └── testing-standards.md     # xUnit patterns
```

**VS Code settings:**
```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {"file": ".vscode/rules/csharp/coding-guidelines.md"},
    {"file": ".vscode/rules/csharp/coding-style.md"},
    {"file": ".vscode/rules/csharp/testing-standards.md"}
  ]
}
```

**Results:** When tested with prompts like "Generate FizzBuzz," Copilot applied documented guidelines, producing code reflecting the defined standards with ~70% adherence.

**Complete ruleset available:** https://github.com/NikiforovAll/dotnet-copilot-rules

### Example 2: Security-Focused Review Prompts

For security-critical code sections:[^10]

**Custom instruction example:**
```markdown
# Security Review Standards

## Authentication & Authorization
- Verify all endpoints have proper authentication
- Check for authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- Ensure password hashing uses bcrypt/Argon2

## Input Validation
- All user input must be validated
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Verify XSS prevention measures

## Sensitive Data
- No credentials in code
- Verify encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Check for secure session management
```

### Example 3: Organizational Policy Implementation

Based on recommendations for organizational AI policies:[^9]

**Recommended policies:**
```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Organizational Policies

## Code Review Requirements
- Require explicit code review for all AI-generated functions
- Prohibit AI generation for authentication or encryption functions
- Document which parts of codebase used AI assistance

## Compliance Requirements
- All AI-generated code must pass OWASP security checks
- Financial calculation code requires manual verification
- HIPAA-covered components require human review

## Refactoring Standards
- Schedule regular refactoring reviews for Copilot-heavy code
- Track technical debt introduced by AI generation
```

## Tips & Quick Wins

### During Code Review

1. **Highlight and Review:** "Highlight any section of code and request an initial review" for immediate feedback[^4]
2. **Source Control Integration:** Review staged/unstaged changes directly from the Source Control tab with inline suggestions[^4]
3. **Language-Specific Prompts:** Ask "Does this follow [language] best practices?" for targeted feedback[^7]

### For PR Authors

1. **Self-Review First:** Get Copilot review before requesting human reviews
2. **Generate Descriptions:** Use Copilot to draft initial PR descriptions
3. **Format Data:** Let Copilot convert metrics/data into markdown tables[^7]

### For Team Leads

1. **Capture Standards Early:** Document team standards in custom instructions as early as possible[^6]
2. **Set Up Automatic Reviews:** Configure automatic reviews on protected branches[^6]
3. **Iterate on Instructions:** Treat custom instructions as living documents that improve over time
